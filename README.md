This is a website that allows photographers to showcase their work to other users.

The website does not need you to install anything. All it needs are:
* An updated browser with plugins and extensions that support the website
* Stable internet connection speeds and also it also needs the user to be constantly connected to the internet since there are some features that whose sources are internet based.

A list of browsers you can use to access this website is Mozila Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Torch Browser, Brave, Safari Browser (Mac), Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer, UC Browser...
At least I gave you a hint of some of the web browsers you can include on your PC or phone. 
## Known Bugs
As of the moment I have no known bugs. The only issue you might encounter is when you try to send me a message via the contact me form and it does not respond. We although are trying our best to fix that.
## Technologies Used
I used a bit of HTML to design the overview and CSS to style the website. I also added javascript and JQuery to make the website responsive.
